"aboutpara": "I‚Äôve always been a bit of a strange person, enough to be considered unique. Since childhood, I‚Äôve been passionate about electronics, disassembling everything from cameras to radios, amplifiers, and even TVs. This passion led me to study Electronics and Telecommunications at the Luigi Bucci Technical Institute in Faenza. My fascination with electronics started with an old book I found in the attic: ‚ÄúDIY Electronics,‚Äù which introduced me to simple projects like building an FM transmitter. It was amazing to transmit my voice through the air to a regular radio. Around 2003, I got my first PC, an Acer Aspire, and soon after, I discovered programming through an old Visual Basic guide of my father‚Äôs. My first program simulated car accidents, calculating G-forces, speed, and trajectories‚Äîa project inspired by my dad‚Äôs job as a traffic cop. As the years passed, I began upgrading my PCs, diving deeper into Apple products, starting with an iPod Classic. This sparked my love for Apple and eventually led me to switch from PC to Mac, a move that completely changed how I viewed technology. High school was a turning point. I started excelling in subjects like math and electrotechnics, which combined electronics and mechanics‚Äîmy true passion. My final project was a robotic arm controlled by a custom programming language, a challenge that took 9 months of hard work but felt incredibly rewarding. After graduation, I skipped university and quickly found a job at IEMCA testing electrical systems. I was motivated by the promise of earning my own salary and the car my parents promised if I found work. A month later, I made the big switch from PC to Mac, fully embracing the Apple ecosystem. Now, I‚Äôm at peace. I‚Äôve found a fantastic job, paid off my Mac, my car, and I‚Äôve built a great Hi-Fi stereo system with my first few paychecks. I no longer need to ask for money from my parents, and I‚Äôve settled into a life that truly reflects who I am.",
